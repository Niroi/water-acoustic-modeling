# water-acoustic-modeling
Gathering some ressources to learn about under water acoustic modeling with the goal to implement and run a CFD simulation that shows sound propagation in water

# TODO:
- [ ] Find more sources on acoustic modeling
- [ ] Research CFD 
- [ ] Write technical review how one would implement a CFD method targeting this topic
- [ ] Implement the strategy
- [ ] Research possibility for implementation as shader/on the gpu
- [ ] Implement on the GPU
